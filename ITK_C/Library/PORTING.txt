# IRI Library Porting Instructions
#

The IRI library has been designed with portability in mind. To port to a
new platform simply copy a platform_*.c file and fill in the API with
code that is appropriate to the new platform.

As a convenient starting point, platform_empty.c has been provided with
empty stubs for each required API call.

For a complete build of the library, one platform_*.c file and all other
.c files in this directory and subdirectories need to be compiled and linked.

See the Examples directory for a Makefile or a Microsoft Visual Studio solution
that compiles an IRI library.
